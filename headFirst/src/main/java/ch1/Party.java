package ch1; // Declares the package for this class, helping organize Java files.

import java.awt.*; // Imports all classes from the java.awt package.
// This package provides core AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) classes
// for graphics and UI components (like Frame, Label, Button, Panel).

import java.awt.event.*; // Imports all classes from the java.awt.event package.
// This package contains classes and interfaces for handling various
// events fired by AWT components (e.g., button clicks), though not
// explicitly used in this snippet's method.

class Party { // Defines a class named 'Party'. This class will encapsulate the logic for
  // building a simple invitation GUI.

  public void buildInvite() { // Defines a public method named 'buildInvite'.
    // This method contains the code to set up the GUI components.
    // 'public' means it can be called from outside this class.
    // 'void' means it doesn't return any value.

    Frame f = new Frame(); // Creates a new 'Frame' object. A Frame is a top-level window
    // that serves as the main window for a GUI application.

    Label l = new Label("Party at Tim's"); // Creates a new 'Label' object with the text "Party at Tim's".
    // A Label is a simple text display area.

    Button b = new Button("You bet"); // Creates a new 'Button' object with the text "You bet".
    // Buttons are clickable UI elements.

    Button c = new Button("Shoot me"); // Creates another 'Button' object with the text "Shoot me".

    Panel p = new Panel(); // Creates a new 'Panel' object. A Panel is a generic lightweight
    // container. It's often used to group other UI components.

    p.add(l); // Adds the 'Label' (l) to the 'Panel' (p). This places the label
    // inside the panel.
  }   // more code here... // This comment indicates that the method is incomplete
  // and would typically contain more setup (e.g., adding buttons
  // to the panel, adding the panel to the frame, setting frame size,
  // making it visible, and handling events).

/*
 * Summary of Concepts:
 * This program demonstrates:
 * 1.  Classes and Objects: Defining a class (`Party`) and creating instances (objects)
 * of various AWT UI components (`Frame`, `Label`, `Button`, `Panel`).
 * 2.  Methods: Defining a custom method (`buildInvite`) to encapsulate related actions.
 * 3.  GUI Basics (AWT): Introduction to fundamental UI components and their instantiation.
 * 4.  Encapsulation: Grouping related UI components and their setup within a method.
 * 5.  Imports: How to bring in classes from external Java packages (`java.awt.*`, `java.awt.event.*`).
 * These are necessary to use pre-built UI components.
